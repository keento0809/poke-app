## About The App

- General Information

[poke-app](https://poke-app-three-mu.vercel.app/) is a simple web application focusing on the usage of Poke REST API fetching data and sending requests with the Server Side Rendering that Next.js has.

This application follows the basic CRUD operation as adding or deleting favorite pokemons registered by users.

## Technologies

- `Next.js` - version 12.1.6
- `TailWind CSS` - version 3.0.24

In addition, I introduced `next-theme` that is a library for next.js, automatically toggling light mode and dark mode based on users' screen modes.

<!-- I used `JavaScript`, `Next.js`, `TailWind CSS`, to create this application. -->

## Setup

- Download or clone the repository
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` to start running the app

## Approach

- Utilize Next.js to simplify compositions of application as well as maximize powerful features of Next.js such as Server-Side Rendering
- Introducing `next-theme` that is a library for next.js, automatically toggling light mode and dark mode based on users' screen modes
- Restricted the initial number of pokemons showcased in home page considering about the workloads of server and performances of the application
- Tried to make design simplify but have good-looking styles by taking advantage of `TailWind CSS` and UI components provided by `flowbite`.
