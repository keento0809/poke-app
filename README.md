## About The App

[poke-app](https://poke-app-three-mu.vercel.app/) is a simple web application focusing on the usage of Poke REST API fetching data and sending requests with the Server Side Rendering that Next.js has.

This application follows the basic CRUD operation as adding or deleting favorite pokemons registered by users.

When it comes to design parts, I utilized TailWind CSS as CSS library and flowbite as the library in order to refer UI components for TailWind CSS.

## Technologies

I used

- `JavaScript`
- `Next.js`
- `TailWind CSS`

for creating this application.

In addition, I introduced `next-theme` that is a library for next.js, automatically toggling light mode and dark mode based on users' screen modes.

<!-- I used `JavaScript`, `Next.js`, `TailWind CSS`, to create this application. -->

## Setup

- Download or clone the repository
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` to start running the app

## Approach

- Utilize Next.js to simplify compositions of application as well as maximize powerful features of Next.js such as Server-Side Rendering
- Restricted the initial number of pokemons showcased in home page considering about the workloads of server and performances of the application
- Tried to make design simplify but have good-looking styles by taking advantage of TailWind CSS and UI components provided by flowbite.
